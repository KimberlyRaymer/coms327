This program implements new characters that will travel around the map while following the constraints given to them. 
'@' is the player which is randomnly positioned in the map as long as they do not end up in the middle of terrain in which they 
cannot get out of. All characters accrue a "cost" when making a move, but each have different weight costs. For example, a 
hiker has less cost in hiking the mountains than a rival, who cannot travel mountains. The terminal outputs these costs for hiker 
and rival along with the map that it base offs of.
