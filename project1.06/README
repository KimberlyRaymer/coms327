The pokemon game now has been converted to all cpp. The pc may now move into other maps via gates or flying. 
The user may press 'f' to activate fly and then put in coordinates (with the -200, 200 range) to which map 
they would like to go to. Otherwise, the user may move the pc to the gate and enter into the map.
