Project 1.01: Terrain Creation

Description: This code generates a terrain with boulders (%), trees/forests (^), tall grass (:),
short grass (.), water (~), roads (#), and one 2x2 pokemon mart (M) and one 2x2 pokemon center (C). 
The map is borded with boulders (%) to keep the player in. The roads are from west to east and 
north to south with an exit on the border to leave the map. The regions (boulders, trees, etc...) 
are randomly generated within the confines of the border. Any empty spaces are filled with random 
items (boulders, trees, etc...).
