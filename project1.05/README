The added new features for the game utilizes ncurses. The map now has color. The pc may move in any which way they wish, 
block by block. The pc can encouter other trainers and battle. The program shows a list of all trainers and where they 
are located relative to the pc. The user can quite the game.


Additional Comments:

Sometimes the pc will randomnly go in a battle even though there is no npc nearby.
I have a feeling this might be the if statements for pc when checking for the npc (line 2516 - 2527).
However, I cannot seem to find the error within the if statements that would cause this.
