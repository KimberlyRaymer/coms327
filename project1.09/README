This program should now be able to fight pokemon and other trainers who are equipped with their own pokemon. 
There should be two moves available for the pokemon to use. In the fights the HP meter should be visibly going down.
In fighting pokemon, there are options to fight, use bag, or runaway. Same for trainers except running away.
